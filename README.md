# PolyAki - my Home Assistant Configuration

I am running [Home Assistant Container](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/#compare-installation-methods) on Unraid OS.

I have setted up following containers: <br/>
[Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana) <br/>
[Influxdb](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb) <br/>
[Telegraf](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf) <br/>
[Plex](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex) <br/>
[ESPHome](https://hub.docker.com/r/esphome/esphome) <br/>

I use home assistant on two tablet and on 4 phones. The first wall mounted tablet is Huawei Mediapad M10 with [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/#get-kiosk-apps). The second tablet is Apple Ipad 4 mini. This is not mounted yet but it will be done on the next few months in the bedroom. I created two view, one fit with mobil and the otherone fit with tablets.
