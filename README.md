# PolyAki - my Home Assistant Configuration

I am running [Home Assistant Container](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/#compare-installation-methods) on Unraid OS.

I have setted up following containers: [Grafana](https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/grafana), [Influxdb](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb), [Telegraf](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf), [Plex](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex), [ESPHome](https://hub.docker.com/r/esphome/esphome) <br/>

I am using a lot of [Sonoff device](https://sonoff.tech/) (BASIC/RF/TH16/POW) with flashed with [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/). <br/>
I use also a lot of [Wemos D1 mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html) with relay (Doorbell or [Windmeter(TX23)](https://www.lacrossetechnology.com/products/tx23u) mith [BH1750](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/348/bh1750fvi-e-186247.pdf) and Temp-sensor). <br/>
I have a lot of other sensor (Waterflow, window sensor, heating system, climate and in each room temp-hum sensors). I use a different branch but in Home Assistent the can work together.

I use home assistant on two tablet and on 4 phones. The first wall mounted tablet is Huawei Mediapad M10 with [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/#get-kiosk-apps). The second tablet is Apple Ipad 4 mini. This is not mounted yet but it will be done on the next few months in the bedroom. I created two view, one fit with mobil and the otherone fit with tablets.

I have actually some issue with my Windmeter (There was a big rain and the case was not fully IP67, so the water goes in and unfortunately killed my ESP Board...) But the newone is on the way, it will be replaced, if I get it.

I inspired from:

[Matt](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config) here you can find his awesome custom UI. <br/>
[Luke](https://github.com/lukevink/hass-config-lajv) here you can find his awesome Floorplan. <br/>
[IIdar](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/xiaomi-cloud-vacuum-map-extractor/231292/555) - his Xiaomi Robot solution for clean up is the best waht I have ever seen. So I implemented it.

I would like to say thank you guys. Your configuration helped me a lot.

Xiaomi Cloudmap Extractor which is combined with my floorplan.
It showed a floorplan with the room where I can set which room should be cleared with [vacuum](https://xiaomi-store.hu/hu/porszivok/1283-xiaomi-roborock-s5-max-black-6970995781939.html). If the vacuum is started then this card will be change for the card where I see live on the floorplan where is my robot.
